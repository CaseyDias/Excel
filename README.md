ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
Excel Data Analysis Project (Course-Based)

This project was completed as part of Luke Barousseâ€™s Data Analytics Excel course. It explores real-world Excel data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard-building techniques in a business context.

Through this guided project, I learned how to transform raw datasets into clear, actionable insights. The completed project file served as a reference to help understand how all the pieces fit together and to see examples of best practices in Excel reporting.

This experience provided valuable exposure to practical workflows and helped strengthen my foundation in Excel for data analytics.

âœ¨ What I Learned
Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis

Building dynamic reports and dashboards

Using formulas to summarize and filter data

Presenting insights visually to support business decisions

ðŸŒ± Next Steps
Iâ€™m continuing to develop these skills by working on independent projects and expanding my portfolio with original examples of data analysis.
