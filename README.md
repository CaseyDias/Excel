ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
Excel Data Analysis Projects (Course-Based)

These projects were completed as part of Luke Barousseâ€™s Data Analytics Excel course. They explore real-world Excel data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard-building techniques in a business context.

Through these guided projects, I learned how to transform raw datasets into clear, actionable insights. The completed project files served as a reference to help understand how all the pieces fit together and to see examples of best practices in Excel reporting.

This experience provided valuable exposure to practical workflows and helped strengthen my foundation in Excel for data analytics.

âœ¨ What I Learned
Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis

Building dynamic reports and dashboards

Using formulas and PivotTables to summarize and filter data

Using the Power of Power Query and Power Pivot:)

Presenting insights visually to support business decisions

ðŸŒ± Next Steps
Iâ€™m continuing to develop these skills by working on independent projects and expanding my portfolio with original examples of data analysis.
